# Monte-Carlo-Integration


Monte Carlo Integration is a sampling method a approximating the area under a complex curve - often required in calculus - that is not easily integrated.

## Alogorithm
 1. Define the domain space to search
 2. Randomly sample from the domain space
 3. Assess the sample to be above or below the true fuction by using its values as inputs
 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 many comes
 5. Compute the total area of domain space
 6. Compute the proportion of samples below the curve: a converging approximation of the true area under the curve
 7. Multiply 5 and 6 to get the estimate for the area under the curve
